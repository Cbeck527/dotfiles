# dotfiles

Default prompts be damned!

Here are my super simple dotfiles for OS X and Linux systems. Kudos to [Adam Szatrowski](https://github.com/adam410) for getting me set up with iTerm2 and on my merry way, [Roger Lopez](https://github.com/zroger) and [Karina Ruzinov](https://github.com/karina) for getting me addicted to VIM, and [Jeff Uthaichai](https://github.com/jeffu) for the global gitignore info.

### vim

* `,d` brings up [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), a sidebar buffer for navigating and manipulating files
* `,f` finds the current buffer in the NERDtree window
* `,t` brings up [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim), a project file filter for easily opening specific files
* `,b` restricts ctrlp.vim to open buffers
* `,a` starts project search with [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim) using [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (like ack, but faster)
* `,gg` toggles gitgutter
* `,gb` for git blame
* `,gs` for git status
* `,/` toggles current line comment
* `,V` silently reloads vim 
* `CTRL + h,j,k,l` move between windows
