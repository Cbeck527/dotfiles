# dotfiles

Default prompts be damned!

Here are my super simple dotfiles for OS X and Linux systems. Kudos to [Adam Szatrowski](https://github.com/adam410) for getting me set up with iTerm2 and on my merry way. Also kudos to [Jeff Uthaichai](https://github.com/jeffu) for the global gitignore info.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like:

* green is current user
* grey is present working directory
* yellow is current virtualenv (see postactivate script to hook into virtualenv)
* blue is current git branch with (X) for out of sync
